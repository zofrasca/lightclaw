`femtobot` is a fast, local-first AI assistant inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), packaged as a single Rust binary.

If you want agentic tooling, memory, and Telegram/Discord integration without a heavy runtime, femtobot is built for that.

## Why femtobot

| Metric | OpenClaw | Nanobot | femtobot |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Distribution | Complex repo | Python + venv | **Single binary** |
| Disk overhead | Heavy | ~350MB env | **~15MB total** |
| Runtime footprint | High | ~100MB+ | **Low footprint** |
| Startup | Slow | ~0.5s | **Near-instant** |

## 60-Second Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enzofrasca/femtobot/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
femtobot configure
femtobot
```

Supported platforms:
- Linux x86_64
- Linux ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers)
- Linux ARMv7 (e.g. older ARM devices / e-readers)
- macOS x86_64
- macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)

Note: A Windows binary exists, but it is currently less stable and not as well-supported as the others.

## What You Get

- Single-binary deploy: ship one executable, no Python runtime.
- Tool-capable agent: file, shell, web, and scheduling actions.
- Telegram/Discord-native interface: high-performance polling built in.
- Local-first memory: vectors + metadata stored locally with SQLite.
- Rust reliability: strong typing, memory safety, and concurrency.
- Skills support: OpenClaw-style `SKILL.md` skills via `activate_skill`.

## Memory System

femtobot includes Rig-style long-term memory:

- Short-term chat history per session.
- Periodic summarization of recent conversation chunks.
- Semantic retrieval over stored memories.
- Privacy-first local storage (no external vector DB required).

## Configuration

Create `~/.femtobot/config.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
      "model_fallbacks": [
        "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        "ollama/llama3.2"
      ]
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-..."
    },
    "openai": {
      "apiKey": "sk-..."
    },
    "ollama": {
      "apiBase": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
    },
    "mistral": {
      "apiKey": "..."
    }
  },
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allow_from": ["123456789"],
      "transcription": {
        "enabled": true,
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "whisper-1",
        "language": "en",
        "max_bytes": 20971520,
        "diarize": false,
        "context_bias": "",
        "timestamp_granularities": ["segment"]
      }
    },
    "discord": {
      "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allow_from": ["123456789012345678"],
      "allowed_channels": ["123456789012345678"]
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "web": {
      "search": {
        "provider": "firecrawl",
        "firecrawlApiKey": "fc-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`tools.web.search.provider` controls both `web_search` and `web_fetch` tool backends.

## Build From Source

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/femtobot
```

Cross-platform build script:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

## Architecture

femtobot uses an actor-like model with a central `MessageBus`:

- `Agent`: context handling and LLM orchestration.
- `Telegram`: chat input/output transport.
- `Discord`: chat input/output transport.
- `Tools`: executable capability modules.
- `Memory`: summary ingestion + retrieval loop.

All components run on a single async Tokio runtime.

## Skills

femtobot can discover and activate OpenClaw-style skills from:

- `~/.femtobot/workspace/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `~/.femtobot/workspace/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`

When relevant, the model can call `activate_skill` to load the full instructions for a skill.

### Skills CLI

femtobot includes a native `skills` command group backed by Rust APIs for ClawHub and skills.sh/source installs.

```bash
# Search on ClawHub
femtobot skills search "calendar"

# Search on skills.sh
femtobot skills find react

# Install from ClawHub
femtobot skills install weather --from clawhub

# Install from source (OpenClaw-compatible project layout)
femtobot skills install vercel-labs/agent-skills --from skills
```

For `--from skills`, installs land in `./skills` under the workspace.
